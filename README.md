# Project Description: Microwave Oven

Programming Language: C

Project Board: Picgenius on picsimlab

Project Simulation: PicSimlab

Coding Interface: MPLab X IDE

Task:
This project involves simulating a microwave oven using the C programming language on the Picgenius board with the assistance of picsimlab for simulation. The development and testing of the code will be done through the MPLab X IDE. The objective is to create a functional simulation of a microwave oven, implementing features such as timer settings, power levels, and system functionalities. Through this project, users can gain hands-on experience in programming embedded systems to control the behavior of a microwave oven.
